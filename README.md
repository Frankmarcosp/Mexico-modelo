# COVID-19_Coupled-Epidemics

We model the spread of the Covid-19 virus with a SEIRD epidemic model with coupled dynamics between countries. See the jupyter notebook for details about the model and a brief discussion about its results.

DISCLAIMER: This is still work in progress, so the results and analysis of this model should not taken as real predictions.
