# COVID-19_Coupled-Epidemics

We make projections of the evolution of the COVID-19 virus in Mexico using a non-compartimental SEIHRD model inspired by the [report](https://covid-19-risk.github.io/map/model.pdf) of Alex Arenas et al.
Run the model by calling the `run_SEIHRD_model.py`. You can change the parameters on the model within the script.

DISCLAIMER: This is still work in progress, so the results and analysis of this model should not taken as real predictions.
